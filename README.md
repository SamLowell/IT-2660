# IT-2660 Data Structures and Algorithms

Introduction to programming using the C and C++ programming languages, emphasizing program development 
and design, debugging techniques, and common basics of the C/C++ languages. Topics include Object-Oriented 
concepts (including classes, objects, attributes, methods and object communication), Structured Programming concepts 
(including control statements, conditions, loops) and Data Structures (including collections), data types, functions, 
argument passing, arrays, strings, structures, data files, and classes.

Assignment 1:  Java Review.
- Ch1Problem41_Lowell:  Review on Java basics.  A simple program with a single class.

- Ch1Problem42_Lowell:  Review creating array and for loops.

Assignment 2:  Arrays. The StudentList class demostrates the creation
of an Array of class Student, adding and deleting a node.

Assignment 3:  Stacks.  The class Stack includes a functions to push, pop, empty the stack and test if 
stack is empty or full.

Assignment 4:  Linked List.  Add node to the end of list, insert a node to specific location, add node the beginning of list,
search list, delete node.

Assignment 6:  Recursion.  Create an array of random integers and then sort the array using a recursion method.

Assignment 7:  Binary Trees.  Store student information in a binary tree.

Assignment 9:  Graph, Queue, Breadth First search, Depth First search, Dijkstar search.  The assignment was to create a randomly generated graph and utualize the three search algorithms: breadth first, depth first and Dijkstar.
